    <p>I am doing the degree of Computer Science with a minor in Automotive Technology. I want to either go into the computer field so i can build PCs and get them up and running for others to use. If that doesn't work I will do something in the automotive industry because we always need more of those.
    </p>
<p>I love riding motorcycles and i Love doing fun activities in groups. I thrive helping others. </p>
<p>I am Single and ready to Mingle! Sorry if i made you cringe.</p>
<p>I want to be able to understand a lot more about the inner workings of computers. i took code in High School and I really enjoyed it and now I want that process to continue.</p>
<p>I have been a memebr my whole life and had some rough patches but never doubted that there is a God.</p>
<p>My favorite Scripture Quote would have to be Helaman 5:12. It is too long to put on here but I love it because it talks about the last days and how we need to survive</p>
<p> My favorite Qutoe from a speaker in General Conference was President Nelson in last conference when he talked about the temple and its importance.<p>
</p> He says "It is significant that the Savior chose to appear to the people at the temple. It is His house. It is filled with His power. Let us never lose sight of what the Lord is doing for us now. He is making His temples more accessible. He is accelerating the pace at which we are building temples. He is increasing our ability to help gather Israel. He is also making it easier for each of us to become spiritually refined. I promise that increased time in the temple will bless your life in ways nothing else can."
