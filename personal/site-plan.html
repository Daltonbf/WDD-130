        Welcome to World Tech Solutions! The site that brings a lot of the most common computer problems and allows the chance for you to find the answer. Our goal is mentioned in the page "Our Why" and we want you to be able to see the solutions to your problems on the "Solutions" page. Feel free to roam around and take your time. We made it so you already saved yourself some of it!

        The reason behind the creation of this webstie is to help those who have computer problems be able to overcome their trials. There are many websites out there that mention different solutions to the same problem. I want to bring the general answer or solution into one and make searching the web a whole lot easier. I want those around me and myself to be able to not run into problems while coding or using our computer in general. World Tech Solutions should be your solution to the problem, not anyone else. Let us do it for you!

      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        Repetitive Code Solution:
        Don't Repeat Yourself is one of the basic principles of programming that you will come across as you learn. This is often shortened to DRY, and code that is written using this principle is called DRY code.
        Repeating code is an easy trap to fall into, and often takes some review to understand just how much code is repeated. As a good rule of thumb, if you're copying and pasting code it's probably repetitive and should be changed.
        Get comfortable using loops and functions to do your work for you and this problem will go away. A web framework can also help you cut down on repetitive code.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Complicated Code Solution:
        Coding is not an IQ test. It's not a challenge to see who can use the most intricate functions or impressive looking files. The code should be written in the spirit of solving problems efficiently. Simple code is easier to write, easier to maintain, and easier to manage.
        To be clear, simple code does not mean taking shortcuts. Simple code means getting down to the heart of the problem you want to solve, and solving it effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping up with Technology
        As technology continues to grow and expand, programmers need to keep up. Frameworks, tools, and libraries become outdated pretty quickly. For example, front-end frameworks usually last for a year or two before new, updated versions come along.
        In a sense, updated versions are good, because they are more efficient and make your job easier. But you also need to get used to them fast — something you may struggle with as a new programmer.
        Veteran programmers know that iterations and frequent updates come with the territory. The most successful releases are updated one to four times in a month. As a new programmer, you might buckle under that pressure.
        The Fix
        There are two easy fixes:
        Take some time to learn new systems: There are only so many hours in the workday to get things done. But it won’t hurt to squeeze in 20 to 30 minutes to learn how new tools work. For example, if you think that you would work better with an updated version of your project management software, learn how to use it in your spare time and use it to improve your workflow once you finally get accustomed to it.
        Keep up with the latest trends: Reading might not be on your list of priorities when there are work deadlines to meet. But keeping up with the latest programming trends will only help you. Learning new coding practices and tools means you will get better at creating code and can develop more innovative products.

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I am figuring out what I will include on my homepage as text. Most likely it may be something for a general description of the site.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        The Solutions page will have a layout very similar to this. Most likely there will be more questions and answers than shown. This is jus the start of the page.
